# With this one, oneâ€™s initial thought might be that the low in part 2
# must be less than the low in part 1, since there are so many more
# inputs in part 2. However, that is not necessarily the case. It could
# be that the low in part 1 was derived from a seed that we do not
# have in part 2, since that seed value now accounts for the range
# from the prior seed.

# We solve this problem by accounting for all the ranges of values (initially 10)
# that undergo the same mapping from one stage to the next. Once we have all
# the ranges that undergo the same mapping, we test the low numbers of each
# range, and take the lowest location that results from starting at those lows.
